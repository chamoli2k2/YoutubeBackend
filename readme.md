# Project is under development so as readme :) [This is demo readme]
# YouTube Backend Project

## Introduction

This project is a backend system inspired by YouTube, where users can upload videos, set avatars and cover images, view their watch history, and interact with videos by liking, commenting, and sharing. It is built using Express.js and MongoDB for the backend, with Cloudinary serving as the backend-as-a-service for storing media files. Postman is used for testing the APIs.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in the `.env` file.
4. Sign up for a Cloudinary account and obtain API credentials.
5. Configure Cloudinary credentials in the `.env` file.
6. Start the server: `npm start`

## Testing

To test the APIs, follow these steps:

1. Import the Postman collection provided in the repository.
2. Ensure that the server is running.
3. Send requests to the endpoints provided in the collection to test different functionalities such as video upload, user interaction, and fetching data.
